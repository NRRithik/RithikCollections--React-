          <b>HISTORY OF RITHIK COLLECTIONS :</b>&nbsp; Becoming Indiaâ€™s no. 1 fashion destination is not an easy
          feat. Sincere efforts, digital enhancements and a team of dedicated personnel with an
          equally loyal customer base have made RITHIK COLLECTIONS the online platform that it is today. The
          original B2B venture for personalized gifts was conceived in 2007 but transitioned into a
          full-fledged ecommerce giant within a span of just a few years. By 2012, Myntra had
          introduced 350 Indian and international brands to its platform, and this has only grown in
          number each passing year. Today Myntra sits on top of the online fashion game with an
          astounding social media following, a loyalty program dedicated to its customers, and
          tempting, hard-to-say-no-to deals.
